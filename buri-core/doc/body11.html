<BR>
                              ----------------<BR>
<BR>
1. Definitions.<BR>
<BR>
     1.1. ``Contributor'' means each entity that creates or contributes to<BR>
     the creation of Modifications.<BR>
<BR>
     1.2. ``Contributor Version'' means the combination of the Original<BR>

     made by that particular Contributor.<BR>
<BR>
     1.3. ``Covered Code'' means the Original Code or Modifications or the<BR>
     combination of the Original Code and Modifications, in each case<BR>
     including portions thereof.<BR>
<BR>
     1.4. ``Electronic Distribution Mechanism'' means a mechanism generally<BR>
     accepted in the software development community for the electronic<BR>
     transfer of data.<BR>
<BR>
     1.5. ``Executable'' means Covered Code in any form other than Source<BR>
     Code.<BR>
<BR>
     1.6. ``Initial Developer'' means the individual or entity identified as<BR>
     the Initial Developer in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A.<BR>
<BR>
     1.7. ``Larger Work'' means a work which combines Covered Code or<BR>
     portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.<BR>
<BR>
     1.8. ``License'' means this document.<BR>
<BR>
     1.9. ``Modifications'' means any addition to or deletion from the<BR>
     substance or structure of either the Original Code or any previous<BR>
     Modifications. When Covered Code is released as a series of files, a<BR>
     Modification is:<BR>
<BR>
          A. Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file<BR>
          containing Original Code or previous Modifications.<BR>
<BR>
          B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original Code or<BR>
          previous Modifications.<BR>
<BR>
     1.10. ``Original Code'' means Source Code of computer software code<BR>

<BR>
     1.11. ``Source Code'' means the preferred form of the Covered Code for<BR>
     making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any<BR>

     compilation and installation of an Executable, or a list of source code<BR>
     differential comparisons against either the Original Code or another<BR>
     well known, available Covered Code of the Contributor's choice. The<BR>
     Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form, provided the<BR>
     appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is widely available<BR>
     for no charge.<BR>
<BR>
     1.12. ``You'' means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights<BR>

2. Source Code License.<BR>
<BR>
     2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.<BR>
     The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,<BR>
     non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property<BR>
     claims:<BR>
<BR>
          (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and<BR>
          distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without<BR>
          Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and<BR>
<BR>
          (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial<BR>
          Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``Utilize'') the<BR>
          Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that<BR>
          any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize<BR>
          the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater<BR>
          extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or<BR>
          combinations.<BR>
<BR>
     2.2. Contributor Grant.<BR>
     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,<BR>
     non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property<BR>
     claims:<BR>
<BR>
          (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and<BR>
          distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or<BR>
          portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other<BR>
          Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and<BR>
<BR>
          (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by<BR>
          Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions<BR>
          thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is<BR>
          reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor<BR>
          Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that<BR>
          may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.<BR>
<BR>
3. Distribution Obligations.<BR>
<BR>
     3.1. Application of License.<BR>
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are<BR>
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation<BR>
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed<BR>
     only under the terms of this License or a future version of this<BR>
     License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this<BR>
     License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not<BR>
     offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or<BR>
     restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'<BR>
     rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document<BR>
     offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.<BR>
<BR>
     3.2. Availability of Source Code.<BR>
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be<BR>
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License<BR>
     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted<BR>
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an<BR>
     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic<BR>
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)<BR>
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six<BR>
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification<BR>
     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for<BR>
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the<BR>
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.<BR>
<BR>
     3.3. Description of Modifications.<BR>
     You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a<BR>
     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and<BR>
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the<BR>
     Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code<BR>
     provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial<BR>
     Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an<BR>
     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the<BR>
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<BR>
<BR>
     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters<BR>
<BR>
          (a) Third Party Claims.<BR>
          If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property<BR>
          right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization<BR>
          under this License), you must include a text file with the source<BR>
          code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and<BR>
          the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient<BR>
          will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You<BR>
          make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You<BR>
          shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make<BR>
          available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying<BR>
          appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to<BR>
          inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has<BR>
          been obtained.<BR>
<BR>
          (b) Contributor APIs.<BR>
          If Your Modification is an application programming interface and<BR>
          You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to<BR>
          implement that API, you must also include this information in the<BR>
          LEGAL file.<BR>
<BR>
     3.5. Required Notices.<BR>
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source<BR>
     Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where<BR>
     You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You<BR>
     created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a<BR>
     Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible<BR>
     to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its<BR>
     structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a<BR>
     relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such<BR>
     a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,<BR>
     support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients<BR>
     of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and<BR>
     not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must<BR>
     make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or<BR>
     liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to<BR>
     indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability<BR>
     incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of<BR>
     warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<BR>
<BR>
     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<BR>
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the<BR>
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,<BR>
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the<BR>
     Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a<BR>
     description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of<BR>
     Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in<BR>
     an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You<BR>
     describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may<BR>
     distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of<BR>
     Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,<BR>
     provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and<BR>
     that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit<BR>
     or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the<BR>
     rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable<BR>
     version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear<BR>
     that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone,<BR>
     not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to<BR>
     indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability<BR>
     incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of<BR>
     any such terms You offer.<BR>
<BR>
     3.7. Larger Works.<BR>
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code<BR>
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger<BR>
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the<BR>
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.<BR>
<BR>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<BR>
<BR>
     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<BR>
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute<BR>
     or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License<BR>
     to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and<BR>
     the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL<BR>
     file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all<BR>
     distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by<BR>
     statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed<BR>
     for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<BR>
<BR>
5. Application of this License.<BR>
<BR>
     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has<BR>
     attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.<BR>
<BR>
6. Versions of the License.<BR>
<BR>
     6.1. New Versions.<BR>
     Netscape Communications Corporation (``Netscape'') may publish revised<BR>
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will<BR>
     be given a distinguishing version number.<BR>
<BR>
     6.2. Effect of New Versions.<BR>
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the<BR>
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that<BR>
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms<BR>
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one<BR>
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to<BR>
     Covered Code created under this License.<BR>
<BR>
     6.3. Derivative Works.<BR>
     If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may<BR>
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code<BR>
     governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the<BR>
     phrases ``Mozilla'', ``MOZILLAPL'', ``MOZPL'', ``Netscape'', ``NPL'' or<BR>
     any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license<BR>
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license<BR>
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and<BR>
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,<BR>
     Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall<BR>
     not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)<BR>
<BR>
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<BR>
<BR>
     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS,<BR>
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,<BR>
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF<BR>
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.<BR>
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE<BR>
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,<BR>
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE<BR>
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER<BR>
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF<BR>
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<BR>
<BR>
8. TERMINATION.<BR>
<BR>
     This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<BR>
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure<BR>
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All<BR>
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall<BR>
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their<BR>
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License<BR>
     shall survive.<BR>
<BR>
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<BR>
<BR>
     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT<BR>
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL<BR>
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,<BR>
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER<BR>
     PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES<BR>
     OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF<BR>
     GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND<BR>
     ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE<BR>
     BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF<BR>
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY<BR>
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW<BR>
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE<BR>
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT<BR>
     EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<BR>
<BR>
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<BR>
<BR>
     The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in<BR>
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer<BR>
     software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such<BR>
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48<BR>
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),<BR>
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those<BR>
     rights set forth herein.<BR>
<BR>
11. MISCELLANEOUS.<BR>
<BR>
     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject<BR>
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<BR>
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<BR>
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by<BR>
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,<BR>
     provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With<BR>
     respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an<BR>
     entity chartered or registered to do business in, the United States of<BR>
     America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating<BR>
     to this License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual<BR>
     property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration,<BR>
     with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any<BR>
     arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara<BR>
     County, California, under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any<BR>
     litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the<BR>
     jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of<BR>
     California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with<BR>
     the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation,<BR>
     court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application<BR>
     of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International<BR>
     Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which<BR>
     provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the<BR>
     drafter shall not apply to this License.<BR>
<BR>
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<BR>
<BR>
     Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with<BR>
     Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or<BR>
     indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based<BR>
     on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the<BR>
     revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant<BR>
     factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute<BR>
     responsibility on an equitable basis.<BR>
